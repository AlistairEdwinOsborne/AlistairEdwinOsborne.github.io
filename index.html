                    <li> You take your move!</li>
                    <li> <font color="red">M.E.N.A.C.E</font> looks for your move in its list and finds a place on the board to put<br> its <font color="red">O</font> the higer the <font color="yellow">coin</font> value the more likely he will pick that move.</li>
                    <li> Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the game is finished. </li>
                    <li> Each move <font color="red">M.E.N.A.C.E</font> has made in the game either has a <font color="yellow">coin</font> taken away or given<br> to it depending if he lost or won!</li>
                </ol> 
                    <br>Whilst playing against <font color="red">M.E.N.A.C.E</font> you can hit the TRAIN button on the bottom right to<br> make him play against a perfect player for a few games, once he's finished see if you<br> can spot moves that he's learnt and if they are good or bad!<br><br></div> 
                <div class = 'perfectinfo'><perfectp1>The Perfect Player</perfectp1><br><br><perfectp2><center>This perfect player is UNBEATABLE!! <br><br>It uses an algorithm known as Minimax that makes it so the computer <br><br> will look at each possible move it can make aswell as all the moves you <br><br>can take then makes its move.

The Human player finds the matchbox showing what the grid looks like at the current time, take a random coin out of the box that represents a place on the board and places its O or X <br> 2. The Human player takes their move <br> 3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the game is finished <br> 4. Then each move taken by menace during that game is either rewarded or punished by adding more coins if it has won or drawn using those moves, or punished by removing a coin if it has lost</div>
